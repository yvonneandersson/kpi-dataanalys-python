# 📊 KPI Data Analysis in Python

This repository contains a Python project where the assignment focuses on building a structured and interactive data analysis tool that examines **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** and price trends across various categories from 1980 to 2022.

The application uses CSV files containing real statistical data from SCB (Statistics Sweden), and enables users to visualize and explore economic trends using a menu-driven terminal interface.
